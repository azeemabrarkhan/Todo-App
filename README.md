# Todo App

This repository contains a **full-stack Todo application** with a **microservices architecture**. The system consists of three main components: a **Todo service**, a **User service**, and a **frontend application**. Each service is containerized using its own Dockerfile, and the entire system can be managed with a single `docker-compose.yaml` file located in the root directory.
